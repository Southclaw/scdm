_yes that stands for "Southclaw Deathmatch"_

An old gamemode I wrote for Â£26 when I was broke.

I eventually burned out by which time I had another income source so quit the job, refunded the money and gave the contractor what I had made so far free of charge (though I don't think it was used).

So I figured I may as well release it as open source since I still own the IP!
